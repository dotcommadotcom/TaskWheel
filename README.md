# TaskWheel

Spend less time figuring out what needs to be done and more time doing with TaskWheel. TaskWheel is a simple task management app that handles the management, leaving you to focus on your tasks. Its standout feature is the Smart Task Picker, which randomly selects tasks for you, prioritizing those with a higher "Do First" score.

## Do First

The "Do First" score evaluates what needs to be done first. Inspired by the principles of the Eisenhower Matrix, the "Do First" score assesses a task's urgency and importance by combining priority level, due date, and creation date. By incorporating creation dates, it ensures tasks don't linger unnecessarily on your to-do list. Unlike typical task management apps, it eliminates the need for manual rule creation and task rearrangement so you can focus on what's important: getting things done.

## Smart Task Picker

Faced with decision fatigue? The Smart Task Picker chooses a task at random for you while prioritizing tasks with higher "Do First" scores. No more agonizing over which task to tackle next - spin the wheel instead. It is a refreshing approach to task selection that relieves the burden of task prioritization and still keeps productivity in mind.
